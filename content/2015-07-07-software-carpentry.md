Authors: William Seviour, Anna Scott

I recently organised a [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/)
workshop with (along with [Anna Scott](http://igert.wse.jhu.edu/anna-scott/)),
in the [JHU Earth and Planetary Sciences Department](http://eps.jhu.edu/). We
had about 40 attendees, and over two days learned about Bash, Python and SQL,
with our instructors [Daniel Chen](http://chendaniely.github.io/2015-06-25-jhu/)
and [Brian Miles](https://github.com/selimnairb).
