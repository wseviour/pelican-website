I am interested in the large-scale dynamics of the atmosphere. In particular, my
research aims to address how better observation and modelling of the
stratosphere could improve surface weather and climate forecasts. I am a member
of the
[Stratosphere and Climate Group](http://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/stratosphere-and-climate)
in the
[Atmospheric, Oceanic and Planetary Physics](http://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/atmospheric-oceanic-and-planetary-physics)
sub-department, supervised by
[Lesley Gray](http://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/contacts/people/grayl). I am also
sponsored by a CASE studentship with the Met Office, and co-supervised by
[Steven Hardiman](http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/our-scientists/climate-chemistry-ecosystems/steven-hardiman).
Before coming to Oxford I completed an MSci in Natural Sciences at the
University of Cambridge.
