I am interested in the large-scale dynamics of the atmosphere. In particular, my research aims to address how better observation and modelling of the stratosphere could improve surface weather and climate forecasts. I am a member of the [Stratosphere and Climate Group](http://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/stratosphere-and-climate) in the [Atmospheric, Oceanic and Planetary Physics](http://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/atmospheric-oceanic-and-planetary-physics) sub-department, supervised by [Lesley Gray](http://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/contacts/people/grayl). I am also sponsored by a CASE studentship with the Met Office, and co-supervised by [Steven Hardiman](http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/our-scientists/climate-chemistry-ecosystems/steven-hardiman).  Before coming to Oxford I completed an MSci in Natural Sciences at the University of Cambridge.
