I am a postdoctoral fellow in the
[Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences](http://eps.jhu.edu/) at [Johns
Hopkins University](http://jhu.edu/).

My interests are in better understanding the dynamics of the Earth's atmosphere,
which is a
[major source of uncertainty](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v7/n10/full/ngeo2253.html)
in projections of regional climate change. In particular, I am investigating how
ozone depletion and greenhouse gases influence past and future climate in the
Antarctic and Southern Ocean.

Previously, I was a graduate student in the
[Stratosphere and Climate Group](http://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/stratosphere-and-climate)
of
[Atmospheric, Oceanic and Planetary Physics](http://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/atmospheric-oceanic-and-planetary-physics),
[Department of Physics](http://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/),
[University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/). I was supervised by
[Lesley Gray](http://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/contacts/people/grayl), and
co-supervised by
[Steven Hardiman](http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/our-scientists/climate-chemistry-ecosystems/steven-hardiman)
as part of a CASE studentship with the Met Office. Before that I completed an
MSci in Natural Sciences at the University of Cambridge.
